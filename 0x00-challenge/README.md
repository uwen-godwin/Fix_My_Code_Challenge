## FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz implementation is printing "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. Your task is to fix this issue.

## Print Square

The implementation is not correctly printing a square of the given size. Your task is to correct the logic to print a square of the specified size.

## Sort

The sorting implementation in Ruby is failing to properly handle non-numeric inputs. Your task is to adjust the sorting logic to handle this case gracefully.

## User Password

The `is_valid_password` method of the User class in Python is not working as expected. Your task is to ensure that the method correctly returns `True` when given the correct password.

## Double Linked List

The double linked list implementation in C has some issues. Your task is to review the provided C files and make sure that the implementation of the double linked list functions is correct and they are being used appropriately.
